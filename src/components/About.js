            <h2>About Me</h2>
            I am a motivated and detail oriented junior who aspires to become a professional. I have experience with programming languages such as C#, Java and SQL and experience with agile environments (Scrum, Kanban). 
            My hands-on approach, analytical mindset, and passion for innovation allow me to effectively collaborate with teams and solve technical problems. I am looking for an opportunity where I can further develop my skills as a Junior Developer or QA Engineer and contribute to dynamic software development.
